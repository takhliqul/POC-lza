# [arc-lza-config](https://github.com/sourcefuse/arc-lza-config)

The files contained in this repository are downstream of the [AWS Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS Sample Configurations](https://github.com/awslabs/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/tree/main/reference/sample-configurations). The purpose of this repository is to simplify the configuration process when deploying the LZA by providing a set of configuration files that can easily be checked into CodeCommit following the initial provisioning of the LZA. 

All credit goes to AWS. We are simply providing another example of LZA configuration.
